JUnit Events is designed for Quality of Service (QOS) testing.  This project
defines QOS as correctness under duress.  The idea is to provide a stable and
scalable architecture to be able to create concurrent testing harnesses.

While you can use this project for your normal, every day correctness testing;
it is designed to put some serious load on your project.  The tests will be
run in separate threads, but the number of threads are not infinite.  The test
harness will allow you to specify a multiplier for the number of physical
processors that your system has.  Based on your machine's architecture and the
multiplier the test harness will create that many threads.
